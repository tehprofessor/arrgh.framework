h1. ARRGH.framework

ARRGH.framework is a dead-simple php MVC framework, that I built to get my hands dirty with some PHP. It currently has database support with phpActiveRecord, and template support
with Smarty. It's mainly some routing functions and a dispatcher that calls the appropriate controller and action by convention rather than configuration. It should be rather easy to setup with other ORMs or templating engines.

It'll receive updates as long as I feel the urge to continue learning php. If you're like, "WTF? Why would he..." the answer: php n00b. I usually program with Ruby ;)

Both Smarty and phpActiveRecord are located in the views directory.

h2. Status

Pre-Alpha: Something might work, it might not work. This is more to help others learning, and myself, than for production (at least currently).

h2. Default Setup

I would recommend just checking out the repo, and starting there!

h3. .htaccess

* .htaccess in the root directory forwards to the public folder.
* .htaccess in the public folder tells the application.php file to process the request UNLESS it matches a folder name.

h3. Configuration

* If you want to change the file structure, you'll need to modify: config/config.php
* Database settings are also located in: config/config.php
* All images, stylesheets, scripts, etc should be placed within the public folder.
* NO HTML OR PHP FILES should go in the 'public' folder except application.php

h3. Routing

* I have included a demo routes file, in config/routes.php 
* There are three class methods (Route::method)
** root_to: this sets the default controller and action when someone accesses http://site.tld/
** static_url: this is to route to a specific page
** resource: this maps the default RESTFUL actions ('index','show','edit', 'destroy'), and delivers an id param to your controller if available
*** index: http://site.tld/posts/ 
*** edit: http://site.tld/posts/1/edit
*** show: http://site.told/posts/1

h3. Controllers

* NAMING CONVENTION
** Filename: pluralized_controller.php (e.g. posts_controller.php, users_controller.php)
** Controller classnames: CamelCaseEachWord. Class UsersController {}; Class UserSessionsController {};
** Controllers should extend the application controller
* Put site-wide controller logic in application_controller.php
* To load a page w/ the default controller, layout, and action: $this->view->render();
* Example controller located at: app/controllers/posts_controller.php

h3. Models

* Models should be singular (e.g. user.php, post.php)
* Model classes need to extend phpActiveRecord
* See phpActiveRecord doc for more info
* Tip: passing the phpActiveRecord Object to Smarty is a pain, this is how I do it (from the controller).

$u = User::find(13);
$u = $u->to_json(array('except' => 'password'));
$u = json_decode($u);
$this->view->set('user', $u);
$this->view->render();

* Example model located at: app/models/post.php


h3. Views (Templates)

* Templates work similarly to ruby on rails, with page templates in: app/views/layouts/ (where you put your HTML TAGS)
* To pass variables from the controller to the template, you will need to assign them from
their respective action with the following method: $this->view->set('var_name', $var) 
* Template variables are Smarty variables, see Smarty doc to see how they work.
* Templates need to use the .tpl extension (Smarty)
* Logic should not be performed in the template, it should be performed in the controller.
